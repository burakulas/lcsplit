# lcsplit
LCSPLIT is a short bash script for splitting the large astronomical light curve data into "one-period-long sub-light curves" to investigate them separately. It is aimed to apply to Kepler light curve data, however, it can be applied all time-related data, technically, by entering the appropriate period value. 

 [ LCSPLIT is a part of LCSPANS (LightCurve SPlit and ANalyse Script) project. ]
