# lcsplit
LCSPLIT is a short bash script for splitting long two-column data into parts based on given period value. The original aim of the script is to split long astronomical data sets like Kepler light curve data into "one-period-long sub-light curves" to investigate them separately. 

 [ LCSPLIT is a part of LCSPANS (LightCurve SPlit and ANalyse Script) project. ]
